# Bittrex-Arbitrage-Discovery
BTCLooping: Cycles through a set number of currency pairs and executes the respective trades when it finds an arbitrage opportunity.
BTCSinglePair: Continually updates one pair but does not have the execution aspect implemented.

The functionality to actually execute the arbitrage opportunity has been added when one is found, but it does not have any checks on it so I would not suggest using it for actual trading. It can be disabled by commenting out lines 114-117 and lines 123-126.
